# Java_SnakeGame

This Java Snake game is a frame based game. 

The snake game has simple functions. It starts at the left top corner of the frame heading towards any direction that user wants it to move. Snake eats appleas and each apple eaten increases the lenght of snake body. Snake will die as well as the game if the snake bites its body parts or any wall around the frame. Each eaten apple increases the score. And score can go infinitely. 

During building this game the most challenge was setting the start location of the snake and fixing the apples from appearing randomly on the top of body parts of a snake. But its been fixed and all is working perfectly. 

Things to improve the game. To set different levels of snake game. For example if the user gets 10 score and the speed of the snake will increase. 
Scenario 2: at the beginning of the game the speed of the snake can be asked from the user as the level of the game beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Relatively speed will be slow, medium and fast. 
Scenario 3: The walls in the game can differ depeding on the score level. If the user hits the 10 score the walls of the game will differ. Like the snake will move to another room.
